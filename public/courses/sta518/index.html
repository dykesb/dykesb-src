<p>This course is about using R to do stuff.
Some of you have little to no programming experience, while others are very proficient coders.
I will provide you with a recommended path based on the course objectives, but I am happy to work with you so that we can design this course to better suite your personal learning goals.</p>
<p>We will make a lot of mistakes through out the semester.
Mistakes provide us with an opportunity to reflect on our current understanding, make adjustments, and update our knowledge.
Make your mistakes <em>loudly</em>.
That is, seek help or clarification during our class meetings and in our online communication platform.</p>

For us to work together as a community, we all must find ways to be present in the various places that our course lives (e.g., during our class meetings or in our online communication).
If you cannot finish your work for any reason, you get stuck, or you do not know where to begin, chat with me (in advance).</p>

<p>A portfolio is a collection of work that provides information about the person doing the work.
Artists and architects have portfolios that show the range and scope of what they do.
By looking at their portfolios, you get a sense of who this person is, how they have grown as a professional, what they have produced, and what they are capable of producing.</p>
<p>This is the intention behind your STA 418/518 Portfolio: you will give a curated collection of your work along with responses to some prompts that tell the story of your growth from the first day of class all the way to the end.
Your goal is to argue, convincingly with concrete evidence, how you have met the criteria for the course objectives and class engagement.
Your portfolio will have three due dates:</p>

<li><strong>Thursday, June 23 at 11:59 pm</strong>: This is a midterm check-in point. While we will not have covered all of the content of the course yet, you will have plenty to reflect on in your Portfolio. The week of June 27, I will check-in individually with each student to discuss your submission.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday, July 21 at 11:59 pm</strong>: Think of this as an opportunity for feedback before your final Portfolio submission. The week of July 25, I will check-in individually with each student that made a submission.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, August 10 at 11:59 pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While you will be receiving a grade at the end of the semester, I will not be putting grades on individual assignments.
Rather, I will ask questions and provide comments to engage with your work rather than simply evaluate it.
Throughout the semester, you will also be responding to your work and the work of your peers in a similar fashion.
The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you are expected to.
I hope that this process will give you (and me) a partial liberation from letter grades, but if it ends up causing more anxiety than it alleviates, feel free to see me at any point to confer about your performance in the course to date.
If you are worried about your grade in the class, your best strategy should be to attend class, take part in discussions, do the readings, and complete all activities.</p>

<p>Microsoft Teams is communication platform that allows us to share documents, seek feedback, ask questions, and provide support.
There are web-based apps, computer apps, and phone apps to seamlessly use this tool across multiple platforms.
A link to our Teams space is provided in Blackboard.</p>
<p>We will spend time during the first few weeks of the semester practicing how to use this tool.
You already have an account for this tool through your GVSU credentials.</p>
<p>By taking a course with me, you are now a part of my learning and scholarship lab that I am calling <code>data-comm</code> (i.e., the Data Community lab).
When you join this space you should see two channels: <strong>General</strong> and <strong>SS2022 STA 418-518 S01</strong>.
Anything you type in the General channel will be viewable by all <code>data-comm</code> members - those in our course and those not in our course.
The SS2022 STA 418-518 S01 channel is a place for conversations specifically about our course.
We can create additional channels as needed; this is our space.</p>

<p>GVSU’s Stats Tutoring Center is both in-person and online this semester, starting Wednesday, September 1!
You can access the most up-to-date information on their website at 
<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/</a>.
There you will find our current hours on both the Allendale (MAK A-2-101) and Pew (EC 608) campus, the hours of our virtual center as well as hours for help with R.
They are hoping to have in-person hours on both campuses Monday–Thursday 10a-5p and Fridays 10a&ndash;2p in Allendale, but these hours may change.
Their in-person centers will follow the same safety protocols as GVSU classrooms.
The virtual Stats Center will be open Sunday-Thursday 5&ndash;9p, but they will add more hours if necessary.
Bring questions to any center about technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.
All Stats Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often.</p>
<p>To access virtual drop-in tutoring, you can use the link in our Blackboard course site called Stats Tutoring Center or visit their website.
Then you will need to click on the “Online Stats Tutoring Center” button, which will require a GVSU login.
When you enter their Collaborate room, please <strong>type your first and last name</strong> so they can get you signed in and connected with a tutor.</p>

<p>I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our class. It is my goal that you feel able to share information about your experiences as a student. I will keep information that you share with me private to the best of my ability; however, there is some information that may need to be shared with the university, especially regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on GVSU’s campus.

<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can negatively impact your learning, such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal or sexual violence, difficulty eating or sleeping, loss/grief, and/or alcohol/drug problems.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and affect your ability to participate in day-to-day activities.

GVSU also provides Special Circumstances and Financial Hardship grants that can be used to assist in paying for many expenses.
Contact the Office of Financial Aid &amp; Scholarships at (616) 331-3234 or visit Special Circumstance &amp; Financial Hardship Requests.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and connect you with other campus resources.</p>

<p>If your state issued identification does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in some areas (such as Blackboard, mailroom, and your GVSU ID). At GVSU, this is called “myName” and you can request a myName by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to myBanner, select the Personal Information tab, then select My Profile.</li>
<li>You will be directed to another authentication page where you will be prompted to enter your network credentials.</li>
<li>On the Personal Details section, select Edit on the and enter your myName.</li>
</ol>
<p>When your myName has been received and reviewed, you will receive an email letting you know either that it has been approved or requesting further information. Once approved, allow up to two days for the myName to be updated across the campus system. More information about myName can be found on the Milton E. Ford LGBT Resource Center’s page.</p>

<p>The university’s academic integrity policy is described in the 
<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GVSU Student Code, Section 4</a>.
Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.</p>
<p>Authorship is a hotly contested topic in academia.
In some disciplines, creative influence, collaboration, and borrowing are usually acceptable (even encouraged) while others have more strict beliefs.
In this class, I encourage you to borrow ideas (from me, from materials we interact with, from your classmates).
But, even more, I encourage you to truly make them your own – by playing with, manipulating, applying, and otherwise turning them on their head.
It is boring to rest on the creations of others.
It is daring (and more fun) to invent something new yourself.
This does not give you license to copy something in its entirety and slap your name on it.
That is just stealing.
Instead, consciously think about how you are influenced by your sources – knowledge and creativity depend on a sort of inheritance. Also think about the real responsibility you have to those sources.</p>

<p>As you are aware, we will be having class this semester while trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19.
I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid.
We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.</p>
<p>What follow are general guidelines for how we can work productively together during STA 418/518.</p>

<p>Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times.
Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
The Mayo Clinic 
<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides several tips</a> for maintaining good self-care in our situation.</p>
<p>While we will not be coming to campus for STA 418/518, you are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home.
If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.</p>
