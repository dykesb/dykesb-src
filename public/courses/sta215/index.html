<p>This is a collaborative course and will be a cooperative learning experience, a true intellectual community.
For us to work together as a community, we all must find ways to be present in the various places that our course lives (e.g., in person, online communication, the rest of the web).
If you cannot finish your work for any reason, chat with me in advance.
Note that on the first day of class, we will decide on a method for managing and participating in backchannel conversations (conversations that do not occur face-to-face).</p>

<p>While you will be receiving a grade at the end of the semester, I will not be putting grades on individual assignments, but rather questions and comments that truly engage with your work rather than simply evaluate it.
Throughout the semester, you will also be responding to your own work and each other’s work in a similar fashion.
The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you are expected to.
I hope that this process will give you (and me) a partial liberation from letter grades, but if it ends up causing more anxiety than it alleviates, feel free to see me at any point to confer about your performance in the course to date.
If you are worried about your grade in the class, your best strategy should be to attend class, take part in discussions, do the readings, and complete all activities.</p>

<p>Modern statistics and data science uses tools to analyze datasets that may contain millions of observations and thousands of variables.
To do even the simplest calculations by hand (e.g., the sum) is impractical.
Therefore, to learn statistics, you must learn the basics of a statistical software program.
In this section of STA 215, we will use the statistical programming language R to automate calculations and create graphs.
I will not ask you to do anything that we have not seen an example of and I will provide you with a document on Blackboard that includes instructions on how to use R for the tasks that we perform.
You will also use R or interpret output from R on course activities.</p>
<p>We will access R/RStudio through GVSU’s RStudio Server.
Directions for how to log in to this server will be provided in an early activity.

<a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R</a> and 
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio</a> are freely available applications.
While you can download them onto your personal machine, I encourage you to use the cloud-based environment that we will cover in class.</p>

<p>GVSU’s Stats Tutoring Center is both in-person and online this semester, starting Wednesday, January 12!
You can access the most up-to-date information on their website at 
<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/</a>.
There you will find our current hours on both the Allendale (MAK A-2-101) and Pew (EC 608) campus, the hours of our virtual center as well as hours for help with R.
They are hoping to have in-person hours on both campuses Monday–Thursday 10a-5p and Fridays 10a&ndash;2p in Allendale, but these hours may change.
Their in-person centers will follow the same safety protocols as GVSU classrooms.
The virtual Stats Center will be open Sunday-Thursday 5&ndash;9p, but they will add more hours if necessary.
Bring questions to any center about technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.
All Stats Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often.</p>
<p>To access virtual drop-in tutoring, you can use the link in our Blackboard course site called Stats Tutoring Center or visit their website.
Then you will need to click on the “Online Stats Tutoring Center” button, which will require a GVSU login.
When you enter their Collaborate room, please <strong>type your first and last name</strong> so they can get you signed in and connected with a tutor.</p>

<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at

<p>The university’s academic integrity policy is described in the 
<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GVSU Student Code, Section 4</a>.
Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.</p>
<p>Authorship is a hotly contested topic in academia.
In some disciplines, creative influence, collaboration, and borrowing are usually acceptable (even encouraged) while others have more strict beliefs.
In this class, I encourage you to borrow ideas (from me, from materials we interact with, from your classmates).
But, even more, I encourage you to truly make them your own – by playing with, manipulating, applying, and otherwise turning them on their head.
It is boring to rest on the creations of others.
It is daring (and more fun) to invent something new yourself.
This does not give you license to copy something in its entirety and slap your name on it.
That is just stealing.
Instead, consciously think about how you are influenced by your sources – knowledge and creativity depend on a sort of inheritance. Also think about the real responsibility you have to those sources.</p>

<p>The mission of the Grand Valley State University General Education Program is to provide a broad-based liberal education experience that fosters lifelong learning and informed citizenship.
The program prepares students for intelligent participation in public dialogues that consider the issues of humane living and responsible action in local, national, and global communities.</p>
<p>STA 215 fulfills the Mathematical Sciences requirement in the Foundations portion of the General Education.
Student Learning Outcomes associated with this portion of the General Education program are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the principles and questions that define computer science, logic, mathematics, or statistics</li>
<li>Apply techniques for problem solving including recognition of key elements, the choice of suitable methods for solving a problem, and the appropriate application of these methods</li>
<li>Quantitative Literacy — competently and confidently work with numbers. Students will:
<ul>
<li>Interpret information appearing in different forms (e.g., graphs, tables, equations, and text).</li>
<li>Evaluate assumptions or biases associated with the chosen method.</li>
<li>Solve quantitative problems using appropriate techniques.</li>
<li>Draw valid conclusions based on data analysis and critically evaluate conclusions made by others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem Solving – design and evaluate strategies to answer open-ended questions. Students will:
<ul>
<li>Construct clear and insightful problem statements that prioritize relevant contextual factors.</li>
<li>Identify multiple approaches for solving the problem within the given context.</li>
<li>Design and fully explain solutions that demonstrate comprehension of the problem.</li>
<li>Evaluate the feasibility of solutions considering the context and impact of potential solutions (e.g., historical, ethical, legal, practical).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>As you are aware, we will be having class this semester while trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19.
I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid.
We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.</p>
<p>What follow are general guidelines for how we can work productively together during STA 215.</p>

<p>Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times.
Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
The Mayo Clinic 
<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides several tips</a> for maintaining good self-care in our situation.</p>
<p>While we will not be coming to campus for STA 215, you are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home. If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.</p>

<p>We will begin the semester in traditional face-to-face format, but several things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup.
Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I cannot be on campus due to self-quarantine, but not because of illness:
For example, if my partner becomes sick or if my daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home.
In this case, we will switch to synchronous online meetings and an asynchronous option might be introduced.</li>
<li>If I cannot be on campus due to having a Covid-19 infection:
The entire course will be moved to an asynchronous online format until I am well enough to resume my responsibilities.
A substitute instructor may be appointed to provide feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either of these two cases, you can expect a slowdown in the feedback process and substantial changes to the course calendar or syllabus.
Please monitor your course announcements daily to ensure you have correct information.
Note that these plans may be changed or overridden by university-wide directives as the semester unfolds.
Again, the course announcements will be where I post any information.</p>
