<p>This is a collaborative course and will be a cooperative learning experience, a true intellectual community.
For us to work together as a community, we all must find ways to be present in the various places that our course lives (e.g., in person, online communication, the rest of the web).
If you cannot finish your work for any reason, chat with me in advance.
Note that on the first day of class, we will decide on a method for managing and participating in backchannel conversations (conversations that do not occur face-to-face).</p>

<p>While you will be receiving a grade at the end of the semester, I will not be putting grades on individual assignments, but rather questions and comments that truly engage with your work rather than simply evaluate it.
Throughout the semester, you will also be responding to your own work and each other’s work in a similar fashion.
The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you are expected to.
I hope that this process will give you (and me) a partial liberation from letter grades, but if it ends up causing more anxiety than it alleviates, feel free to see me at any point to confer about your performance in the course to date.
If you are worried about your grade in the class, your best strategy should be to attend class, take part in discussions, do the readings, and complete all activities.</p>

<p>Modern statistics and data science uses tools to analyze datasets that may contain millions of observations and thousands of variables.
To do even the simplest calculations by hand (e.g., the sum) is impractical.
Therefore, to learn statistics, you must learn the basics of a statistical software program.
In this section of STA 216, we will use the SAS statistical programming language to automate calculations and create graphs.
I will not ask you to do anything that we have not seen an example of and I will provide you with a document on Blackboard that includes instructions on how to use R for the tasks that we perform.
You will also use SAS or interpret output from SAS on course activities.</p>
<p>We will access SAS through their SAS OnDemand for Academics program which provides free access to their software in the cloud.
Directions for how to create an account and log in to this service will be provided in an early activity.
Note that there are ways to install SAS onto your personal machine, but I encourage you to use the cloud-based environment that we will cover in class.</p>

<p>Microsoft Teams is communication platform that allows us to share documents, seek feedback, ask questions, and provide support.
There are web-based apps, computer apps, and phone apps to seamlessly use this tool across multiple platforms.
We will spend time during the first week of the semester practicing how to use this tool.
You already have an account for this tool through your GVSU credentials.</p>

<p>GVSU’s Stats Tutoring Center is both in-person and online this semester, starting Wednesday, August 31!
You can access the most up-to-date information on their website at 
<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/</a>.
There you will find our current hours on both the Allendale (MAK A-2-101) and Pew (EC 608) campus, the hours of our virtual center as well as hours for help with R.
They are hoping to have in-person hours on both campuses Monday–Thursday 10am-5pm and Fridays 10am&ndash;2pm in Allendale, but these hours may change.
Their in-person centers will follow the same safety protocols as GVSU classrooms.
The virtual Stats Center will be open Sunday-Thursday 5&ndash;9pm, but they will add more hours if necessary.
Bring questions to any center about technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.
All Stats Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often.</p>
<p>To access virtual drop-in tutoring, you can use the link in our Blackboard course site called Stats Tutoring Center or visit their website.
Then you will need to click on the “Online Stats Tutoring Center” button, which will require a GVSU login.
When you enter their Collaborate room, please <strong>type your first and last name</strong> so they can get you signed in and connected with a tutor.</p>

<p>I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our class. It is my goal that you feel able to share information about your experiences as a student. I will keep information that you share with me private to the best of my ability; however, there is some information that may need to be shared with the university, especially regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on GVSU’s campus.

<p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at

Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.</p>
<p>Authorship is a hotly contested topic in academia.
In some disciplines, creative influence, collaboration, and borrowing are usually acceptable (even encouraged) while others have more strict beliefs.
In this class, I encourage you to borrow ideas (from me, from materials we interact with, from your classmates).
But, even more, I encourage you to truly make them your own – by playing with, manipulating, applying, and otherwise turning them on their head.
It is boring to rest on the creations of others.
It is daring (and more fun) to invent something new yourself.
This does not give you license to copy something in its entirety and slap your name on it.
That is just stealing.
Instead, consciously think about how you are influenced by your sources – knowledge and creativity depend on a sort of inheritance. Also think about the real responsibility you have to those sources.</p>

Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19.
I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid.
We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.</p>

<p>Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times.
Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
The Mayo Clinic 
<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides several tips</a> for maintaining good self-care in our situation.</p>
<p>You are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home. If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.</p>

<p>We will begin the semester in traditional face-to-face format, but several things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup.
Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I cannot be on campus due to self-quarantine, but not because of illness:
For example, if my partner becomes sick or if my daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home.
In this case, we will switch to synchronous online meetings and an asynchronous option might be introduced.</li>
<li>If I cannot be on campus due to having a Covid-19 infection:
The entire course will be moved to an asynchronous online format until I am well enough to resume my responsibilities.
A substitute instructor may be appointed to provide feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either of these two cases, you can expect a slowdown in the feedback process and substantial changes to the course calendar or syllabus.
Please monitor your course announcements daily to ensure you have correct information.
Note that these plans may be changed or overridden by university-wide directives as the semester unfolds.
Again, the course announcements will be where I post any information.</p>
