      <description>Nothing in this syllabus is set in stone. This is not designed to be a map or a contract, but rather a starting place with the goal of transforming the syllabus (and our learning) as we go. Throughout this semester, we will discover and question what we do, together.
Drop-in Hours     Since we will be doing a lot of active work during our class sessions, our in-person class meetings on Tuesday and Thursday, 4 â€“ 5:15 pm will be the best place to seek direct assistance/feedback on course topics.</description>

      <description>Nothing in this syllabus will be set in stone or taken for granted. This is not designed to be a map, but rather a starting place with the goal of transforming the syllabus as we go. We will discover and question what we do together, even as we begin.
Drop-in Hours     I will be holding virtual drop-in hours throughout the semester. A link and time for these sessions will be posted on the Blackboard course site.</description>
