description: I teach applied statistical methods and statistical computing at Grand Valley State University. I am interested in working with educators to integrate data and statistical thinking into their courses. One of my current collaborations uses data visualizations in K-12 history and social studies lessons to build students' data literacy. I love coffee, Great Danes, and board games.
