Nothing in this syllabus will be set in stone or taken for granted.
This is not designed to be a map, but rather a starting place with the goal of transforming the syllabus as we go.
We will discover and question what we do together, even as we begin.

## Drop-in Hours

I will be holding virtual drop-in hours throughout the semester.
A link and time for these sessions will be posted on the Blackboard course site.
These times for you; you will not be interrupting me. 
Feel free to talk about something *off topic* or if you simply want to touch base about something.

## Class Time

**Meetings and Location**: 

- Section 02: Tuesday and Thursday, 11:30am--12:45pm, MAK A-2-111.
- Section 04: Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30--3:45pm, online (link provided on Blackboard).

### Face Coverings

For GVSU’s most up-to-date face covering policy, consult https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm.

## Course Description

Project-oriented introduction to major statistical techniques using a statistical package such as SAS or SPSS.
Hypothesis testing, t-test, multivariate regression, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, chi-square tests, and nonparametric statistics.

### Prerequisite

STA 215 or STA 312

## Required Resources

**WHAT**

## Course Objectives

In this course, we will:

- Produce and interpret graphical and numerical summaries of data and understand the role of variability.
- Use statistical models to describe the distribution of variables, especially the distribution of one or more variables conditional upon the values of one or more other variables.
- Use basic ideas of statistical inference, including both hypothesis testing and interval estimation, in a variety of settings.
- Demonstrate basic statistical programming skills.

## The work of this course

This course will be as much about breaking stuff as it is about building stuff. 

### Participation

This is a collaborative course and will be a cooperative learning experience, a true intellectual community.
For us to work together as a community, we all must find ways to be present in the various places that our course lives (e.g., in person, online communication, the rest of the web).
If you cannot finish your work for any reason, chat with me in advance.
Note that on the first day of class, we will decide on a method for managing and participating in backchannel conversations (conversations that do not occur face-to-face).

### Activities

The Weekly Content area in our Blackboard course site will walk you through the various activities of the week.
These will include readings, videos, suggested practice exercises, workshops, and self-reflections.

### Major Project

Throughout the semester, you will work on a single statistical project (on your own or in a group).
We will determine the parameters of this project together early in the semester.

### Course Grading

While you will be receiving a grade at the end of the semester, I will not be putting grades on individual assignments, but rather questions and comments that truly engage with your work rather than simply evaluate it.
Throughout the semester, you will also be responding to your own work and each other’s work in a similar fashion.
The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you are expected to.
I hope that this process will give you (and me) a partial liberation from letter grades, but if it ends up causing more anxiety than it alleviates, feel free to see me at any point to confer about your performance in the course to date.
If you are worried about your grade in the class, your best strategy should be to attend class, take part in discussions, do the readings, and complete all activities.

## Technology

### Blackboard

All assignments, documents, and feedback will be posted on the [Blackboard](https://mybb.gvsu.edu/) course site.
You will also use this for submitting assignments.

The calendar in Blackboard will be used for all important time-sensitive information.
This calendar will be kept up to date to the best of my ability.
If you notice any conflicts in times or dates, please let me know so that I can correct them.

### SAS Studio

Modern statistics and data science uses tools to analyze datasets that may contain millions of observations and thousands of variables.
To do even the simplest calculations by hand (e.g., the sum) is impractical.
Therefore, to learn statistics, you must learn the basics of a statistical software program.
In this section of STA 216, we will use the SAS statistical programming language to automate calculations and create graphs.
I will not ask you to do anything that we have not seen an example of and I will provide you with a document on Blackboard that includes instructions on how to use R for the tasks that we perform.
You will also use SAS or interpret output from SAS on course activities.

We will access SAS through their SAS OnDemand for Academics program which provides free access to their software in the cloud.
Directions for how to create an account and log in to this service will be provided in an early activity.
Note that there are ways to install SAS onto your personal machine, but I encourage you to use the cloud-based environment that we will cover in class.

### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is communication platform that allows us to share documents, seek feedback, ask questions, and provide support.
There are web-based apps, computer apps, and phone apps to seamlessly use this tool across multiple platforms.
We will spend time during the first week of the semester practicing how to use this tool.
You already have an account for this tool through your GVSU credentials.

## Getting Help

The best resource for getting help in this class will be to show up to our sessions and ask questions.
However, this is not always when issues or questions arise.
To assist in these situations, there are a number of additional ways to seek assistance.

### Microsoft Teams

For help with course tools, materials, or other items, ask questions in the appropriate channel on Teams.
I and your peers will be your best resources throughout the semester for specific questions about this course.

### Stats Tutoring Center

GVSU’s Stats Tutoring Center is both in-person and online this semester, starting Wednesday, August 31!
You can access the most up-to-date information on their website at https://www.gvsu.edu/tutoring/stats/.
There you will find our current hours on both the Allendale (MAK A-2-101) and Pew (EC 608) campus, the hours of our virtual center as well as hours for help with R.
They are hoping to have in-person hours on both campuses Monday–Thursday 10am-5pm and Fridays 10am--2pm in Allendale, but these hours may change.
Their in-person centers will follow the same safety protocols as GVSU classrooms.
The virtual Stats Center will be open Sunday-Thursday 5--9pm, but they will add more hours if necessary.
Bring questions to any center about technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.
All Stats Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often. 

To access virtual drop-in tutoring, you can use the link in our Blackboard course site called Stats Tutoring Center or visit their website.
Then you will need to click on the “Online Stats Tutoring Center” button, which will require a GVSU login.
When you enter their Collaborate room, please **type your first and last name** so they can get you signed in and connected with a tutor. 

### Tutoring Center

GVSU’s general Tutoring Center is offering appointment tutoring in-person and virtually.
You can sign up for 50-minute tutoring appointments for many Stats courses.
Request a tutor at http://www.gvsu.edu/tc/ or schedule directly on [Navigate](https://www.gvsu.edu/navigate/).
Questions about the Tutoring Center can be directed to tutoring@gvsu.edu.

### Technology Help

I am not able to provide support for most technological issues.
If you encounter issues with technology, use one of the following resources:

-	For help with Blackboard: Email the GVSU Blackboard Help Desk (bbadmin@gvsu.edu) or call (616) 331-8526. For hours and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help.

-	For specific help with your computer or device: Contact the GVSU IT Help Desk (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer of computer store.
-	For help with course tools or applications: Ask a question on the discussion board, seek out the help documentation in the tool or application, or do a targeted Google search.

## Equitable and Inclusive Learning Environment

I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our class. It is my goal that you feel able to share information about your experiences as a student. I will keep information that you share with me private to the best of my ability; however, there is some information that may need to be shared with the university, especially regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on GVSU’s campus. Below are additional resources available for support:

### Title IX, Sexual Misconduct Policy, and Gender- and Sexual-Based Harassment Policy

Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at https://www.gvsu.edu/titleix or contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Theresa Rowland at (616) 331-9530 or rowlanth@gvsu.edu.

### Special Learning Needs

If you have special needs because of learning, physical, or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616) 331-2490 or https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr.
DSR will help you arrange accommodations.
Then, set up an appointment with me about how I can help in making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR. 

### Basic Security Needs

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can negatively impact your learning, such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal or sexual violence, difficulty eating or sleeping, loss/grief, and/or alcohol/drug problems.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and affect your ability to participate in day-to-day activities.
To support you during such challenging times, GVSU provides several confidential resources to all enrolled students, including the University Counseling Center https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel or (616) 331-3266 and the Student Ombuds, Takeelia Garrett garrettt@gvsu.edu.

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit [Replenish](https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/), a food resource for GVSU students.
GVSU also provides Special Circumstances and Financial Hardship grants that can be used to assist in paying for many expenses.
Contact the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships at (616) 331-3234 or visit Special Circumstance & Financial Hardship Requests. 

If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and connect you with other campus resources.

### Gender expression and identity

If your state issued identification does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in some areas (such as Blackboard, mailroom, and your GVSU ID). At GVSU, this is called “myName” and you can request a myName by following these steps:

1. Login to myBanner, select the Personal Information tab, then select My Profile.
2. You will be directed to another authentication page where you will be prompted to enter your network credentials.
3. On the Personal Details section, select Edit on the and enter your myName.

When your myName has been received and reviewed, you will receive an email letting you know either that it has been approved or requesting further information. Once approved, allow up to two days for the myName to be updated across the campus system. More information about myName can be found on the Milton E. Ford LGBT Resource Center’s page.

## Academic Integrity

The university’s academic integrity policy is described in the [GVSU Student Code, Section 4](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774).
Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.

Authorship is a hotly contested topic in academia.
In some disciplines, creative influence, collaboration, and borrowing are usually acceptable (even encouraged) while others have more strict beliefs.
In this class, I encourage you to borrow ideas (from me, from materials we interact with, from your classmates).
But, even more, I encourage you to truly make them your own – by playing with, manipulating, applying, and otherwise turning them on their head.
It is boring to rest on the creations of others.
It is daring (and more fun) to invent something new yourself.
This does not give you license to copy something in its entirety and slap your name on it.
That is just stealing.
Instead, consciously think about how you are influenced by your sources – knowledge and creativity depend on a sort of inheritance. Also think about the real responsibility you have to those sources.

## COVID-19

As you are aware, we will be having class this semester while trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19.
I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid.
We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.

What follow are general guidelines for how we can work productively together during STA 216.

### Taking care of yourself

Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times.
Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
The Mayo Clinic [provides several tips](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic) for maintaining good self-care in our situation.

You are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home. If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.

### Contingency plans for the semester

We will begin the semester in traditional face-to-face format, but several things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup.
Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.

- If I cannot be on campus due to self-quarantine, but not because of illness:
  For example, if my partner becomes sick or if my daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home.
  In this case, we will switch to synchronous online meetings and an asynchronous option might be introduced.
- If I cannot be on campus due to having a Covid-19 infection:
  The entire course will be moved to an asynchronous online format until I am well enough to resume my responsibilities.
  A substitute instructor may be appointed to provide feedback.

In either of these two cases, you can expect a slowdown in the feedback process and substantial changes to the course calendar or syllabus.
Please monitor your course announcements daily to ensure you have correct information.
Note that these plans may be changed or overridden by university-wide directives as the semester unfolds.
Again, the course announcements will be where I post any information.
